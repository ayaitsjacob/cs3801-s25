                                    Whistleblowing & Ethical Advocacy in Tech go hand in hand. Ethical Advocacy in Tech is advocacy for ethical practices of hiring in tech,
                                    designing with privacy, accessibility, and inclusive in mind, and it can even mean advocacy for sustainability and oversight for environmental
                                    impact. Whistleblowing is the act of a person, not seeing or feeling a tech workplace is practicing ethical advocacy so they take it upon themself
                                    to (in a way) force ethical advocacy by revealing information about activity within their tech workspace that they deemed illegal, immoral,
                                    illicit, unsafe, unethical or fraudulent.

                                        Kantian Ethics is the moral philosophy that emphasizes duty, rules, and the intrinsic worth of individuals and morality is based on adherence to
                                        universal principles and duty. In the context of whistleblowing and ethical advocacy in tech, Kantian ethics emphasizes moral duty, honesty, and
                                        acting from principle. So, a whistleblower who exposes wrongdoing because it's the right thing to do is in the right because it is ethically
                                        required for them to do so even if the personal consequences are severe.

                                        Utilitarianism is the idea that actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they promote the reverse, so it focuses on the
                                        consequences of one's actions. If a whistleblower prevents major harm or benefits society by whistleblowing to stop a tech company that is
                                        promoting the reverse, then it is morally justice.

                                    <h3>CHRISTOPHER WYLIE</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        An example of whistleblowing in the pursuit of ethical advocacy was when Christopher Wylie exposed how millions of Facebook users' data were
                                        harvested without consent and used for political advertising and manipulation (notably in the Brexit vote and 2016 U.S. election). He did this
                                        without regard for his own wellbeing. Wylie became a whistleblower because they believed in the dangers of data misuse and manipulation in tech
                                        and under Kantian ethics, they had a moral duty to expose Facebook. As a result of Wylie's advocacy there was a massive backlash against
                                        Facebook which let to congressional hearings, and "General Data Protection Regulation" enforcement in Europe.

                                        A second explain of a whistleblower advocating for ethical practices in tech is when Susan Fowler published a blog posting detailed systemic
                                        sexual harassment and toxic culture at Uber, which management ignored. Fowler's reporting on Uber sparked the #METOO movement in tech and led to
                                        broader discussions about gender discrimination, the CEO of Uber Travis Kalanick resigned, and Uber overhauled its internal culture. So, under
                                        Utilitarianism, Fowler was in the right because they're whistleblowing led to disciplinary actions against bad behavior and promoted happiness
                                        and awareness about workplace discrimination.a

                                Some guidance when thinking about whistleblowing would be that it's not always as black and white as it might seem. Just because there is some
                                wrongdoing does that mean you MUST whistle blow even if you are morally in the right? The USA would say no because when Julian Assange revealed that the
                                USA was torturing people, they argued that his whistleblowing endangered the lives of American soldiers.

                                    We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google. Here's what it says. <i class="ion-ios-arrow-right"></i>

                                It was easy to write about whistleblowing and using ethical frameworks learn in class to back up my reasoning but the
                                "Ethical Advocacy in Tech" part threw me off because I didn't know if there was something specific I was supposed to talk about or if it just meant
                                general ethical advocacy in tech. I ended up choosing the latter and I decided to talk about whistleblowing to advocate all aspects of ethics in tech.
                                BUT if I'm wrong please let me know so I just review and adjust.
