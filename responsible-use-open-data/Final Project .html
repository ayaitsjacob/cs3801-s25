		    							Open data is a free dataset that anyone can access, use, or edit as long as there 
										is internet access. Examples of open data would be weather data, demographic 
										information, and the political and economic state of the world. The main 
										goal of open data is to improve transparency, innovation, and public engagement. 
										Government and organizations around the world have published countless datasets to 
										the public, with the very hope that people can use them to inform other people, build 
										useful tools, and understand social and economic trends. Well, despite these benefits, ethical 
										concerns are on the rise. Since there have been incidents of privacy violations, misuse of 
										data, lack of credit to the researcher, misinformation, or unfair access to technology to get 
										hold of open data. While the intention behind open data is very noble, the risks of using it 
										shouldn’t be ignored. Some responsible usage should mean ensuring accuracy, preventing harm 
										from happening, protecting individual privacy, and ensuring that the data being published 
										to the public doesn’t have anything malicious or misleading. This is all very important as 
										data has a significant impact on people’s lives; it is essential to develop and follow 
										guidelines that promote its ethical use and access to it.

		    							An ethical framework we could look through would be Kantian ethics,  
										which is grounded in universal moral laws and treating individuals 
										as ends in themselves-not merely as means to an end. This 
										perspective shows that the act of sharing data should come from 
										a sense of moral duty. Open data, as a whole, aligns with this duty 
										because it supports education and innovation. Regardless, Kantian 
										ethics also emphasizes the importance of consent and respect. 
										Publishing data without any sort of permission goes against this principle. 
										Moreover, using a researcher's data without credit or any sort of 
										compensation, regardless of whether it is freely available, could still 
										be seen as disrespecting their work.

		    					<div class="col-md-12">
		    						<p>
		    							Another ethical framework that can also be used 
										for this topic is utilitarianism, since it focuses 
										on he greatest good for the greatest number. Open 
										data can lead to a lot of positive outcomes, like 
										increasing public knowledge, better decision-making, 
										and social benefits. Again, we can’t ignore any of the 
										cons, like how some data can be used to reinforce 
										stereotypes or discrimination, and then the overall 
										utility is compromised. Utilitarianism challenges data 
										user to carefully consider both the benefits and potential harm of their action.

		    							A controversial example is the case of Aaron Swartz, a digital 
										rights activist who downloaded millions of academic articles from 
										JSTOR via MIT’s network, intending to make them freely available. 
										MIT and the federal prosecutor accused him of fraud. Swarts argued 
										that he acted on moral grounds, promoting public access to knowledge. 
										This case shows the ethical tension. Swarts sought to serve the public 
										good, however, he went through the legal and institutional norms. Through 
										the lens of both Kantian and Utilitarianism ethics, the situation is 
										very complex as his motives were grounded in him to benefit others, though 
										the outcome was his persecution and even suicide. This highlights the danger 
										of unbalanced approaches to access and accountability.
