                                        Doomscrolling is a behavioral issue where users spend an excessive amount of time browsing social media, driven by platform features designed to keep them engaged. Persuasive and manipulative algorithms on these platforms encourage prolonged use, often keeping users on the app for numerous hours at a time, often to unhealthy degrees.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to a decrease in productivity and wasting time, doomscrolling has also been associated with clinical issues such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. According to <a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/doomscrolling-again-expert-explains-why-were-wired-for-worry">an article on UC San Diego Today</a>, the human body “may respond to repeated bad news as if it were in continuous danger, involving changes like stress hormone surges, increased heart rate and feeling on edge or exhausted.”  When exposed to this type of negative social media for long periods of time, it could contribute to anxiety or depression.

                                    On the other hand, “brainrot” refers to low quality internet content and the negative psychological effects that arise as a result of consumption. While oftentimes, brainrot is viewed as the cultural slang developed by younger generations, the brainrot being studied here refers to the apparent negative effects on users’ attention span.

Specifically they found, “a higher propensity for short video addiction may impair executive control,” and "a strong negative correlation between short video addiction and self-control abilities." It then went on to explain how prolonged exposure engages lower-order cortical brain regions while suppressing the higher order areas that are used for self control and attention among other things.

                                    Virtue ethics focuses on being a good person and doing what’s right. For developers, this means designing mental health tools with kindness, honesty, and care. Instead of just following rules or aiming for profits, designers guided by virtue ethics think about how their work affects others. They aim to support users by creating apps that are honest, helpful, and respectful, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like anxiety, depression, and addiction.

                                    Mill’s utilitarianism focuses on doing what brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people. For mental health design, this means weighing the benefits of features like mood tracking or reminders against any harm they might cause, such as anxiety or over-reliance. Ethical tools should increase overall wellbeing while minimizing possible negative effects.

                                <p>
                                    Kant’s Categorical Imperative teaches that we should only act in ways we’d want everyone else to act, and that we must always treat people as ends in themselves, never just as a means to an end. In the context of mental health technology, this means developers have a duty to respect users’ autonomy, privacy, and dignity. For example, collecting sensitive mental health data without clear consent, or designing features that exploit user behavior for profit, would violate this principle. An ethically designed mental health app, guided by the Categorical Imperative, would instead be transparent, fair, and supportive—something we’d want all mental health tools to be if the practice became universal.

                                <h3>RAWLS</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Rawls argued that a just society is one that protects the rights of the least advantaged. In digital mental health tools, this means ensuring that privacy is not a luxury, but a right for everyone. Users entrusting an app with sensitive information—like anxiety levels, depression symptoms, or therapy history—deserve systems that guard that data rigorously. According to Rawls, ethical design would create platforms where mental health support is equally accessible and where no one is put at risk simply for seeking help. Developers must design with fairness, equity, and user safety in mind.

                                        We joined a Discord call as a group and shared a Google Doc to brainstorm and share our thoughts. While we wrote down our thoughts in the doc, we also took the time to review and even correct each other's work if needed. The work was divided evenly to ensure we all contributed something. All our work was properly organized so that way no one in the group got confused about anything. We even took mental health breaks in between brainstorms to enhance the collaborative process and reduce mental fatigue or burnout.
